## Earthquake Visualization

### Problem

###### Create interactive map visualizing a 30-day worldwide earthquake data. Also show earthquakes' relationship with tectonic plates.



### Process

###### Visit http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php , and select the JSON representation of a dataset. Use the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for visualization.
###### Write code that utilize Javascript to create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.
###### API is required to access Leaflet and Mapbox. Mapbox requires an account registration. An API key access is provided upon a successful registration. Leaflet is free and no account needed.
###### Mapbox creates the base map while Leaflet creates one or more layers depending on how many features added to the base map.
###### To illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and earthquake occurences, pull another set of data from https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates and visualize it along side original dataset.
###### Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently. Then add layer controls to map.
